## JTTree

A more useful wrapper around [CFTree](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/CoreFoundation/Reference/CFTreeRef/) (with apologies to [NSTreeNode](https://developer.apple.com/library/mac/documentation/cocoa/reference/NSTreeNode_class/)).

Born out of a desire to not work with CFTree objects.

## Installation with [CocoaPods](http://cocoapods.org/)

```ruby
pod "JTTree", :git => "https://github.com/jtbandes/JTTree.git"
```

## Documentation

See [`JTTree.h`](src/JTTree.h) for API. To quote the overview:

> Each tree node can store a reference to an object. Most methods come in pairs: one to act on tree nodes, and one to act on stored objects directly.

> Two JTTree objects are equal (according to `-isEqual:`) iff they refer to the same underlying tree node. (Pointer equality is not guaranteed.)

> All behavior not explicitly specified here (such as nil return values, tree lifetime, etc.) should be assumed to be the same as CFTree, which, in many cases, also does not specify its behavior explicitly.
